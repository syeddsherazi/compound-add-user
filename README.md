# compound-add-user

I found the test to be bit small so implemented a bit of extra features ( front end + lambda functions ) on my own.
Solution details:
* You can add a user.
* View user's details in json format.
* List all added users.
* Delete a user.

Project is setup using Angular Cli. For this you'll need node and angular cli installed. In case you donot have these installations just follow these steps on Linux / Ubuntu.

* STEP 1 : Install nodeJS ===>  sudo apt install nodejs
* STEP 2 : Install Angular Cli ===> npm install -g @angular/cli
* STEP 3 : Clone the github repo, go to the project folder and install dependencies via ==> npm install
* STEP 4 : While in the project folder, serve the project using command ===> ng serve

Now you can view the local serve on your browser.
Since Google recaptcha doesn't allow localhost as domain so please view the project using http://127.0.0.1:4200 on your browser.

Incase of any queries, or any issue regarding setup feel free to reach out to me.
